This year Creative Commons has a much more limited focus on what we would like to see out of Google Summer of Code than in previous years.

### Installation
The latest version of the plugin is 0.7.0, available for download from the [OpenOffice.org Extension site](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/ccooo)
To install:

* Download the plugin
* Open OpenOffice.org
* Go to the `Tools` menu and select `Extension Manager`. Click `Add` and select the file you downloaded.
* After the installation process completes, restart OpenOffice.org. The Creative Commons menu options will be located at the bottom of the `Insert` menu.

Debian/Ubuntu (& other variants) users:
* Debian/Ubuntu (& other variants) users may have problems if the plugin installed using the Extension Manager.
* They may need to install the plugin using the terminal.
* To install use /usr/lib/openoffice/program/unopkg gui -f ccooo.oxt

### Problem Statement
The current Creative Commons LibreOffice (OpenOffice) plugin is written in Java. This project is aimed to port the current plugin to Python while rectifying the problems in the current plugin.

### Solution
The Python port of the Creative Commons Add-in for LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org which allows license information to be embedded in OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice Writer, Impress, Draw and Calc documents.

For more information visit [the official addin page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin) of Creative Commons

### Testing
Download the out.oxt file. Install it via the LibreOffice Extension Manager (Tools --> Extension Manager).

Then go to `Insert` `--> ` `Creative Commons`. By using the first option you can insert the license information to the document. The second option is for changing those data.

### Knowledge Prerequisite
`Python` ,`Shell`

CC LibreOffice is only possible due to the support and guidance of  `CC tech staff member`, who have been very supportive on every step of the project.
The project is approaching its completion. Can't wait to see it in production.
